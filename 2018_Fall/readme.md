# Task
Submit a Pull Request to this file, checking off your name :white_check_mark:. Feel free to add some :rocket: emoji after your name as well :smiley: ! 

## Formatting
This is a Markdown document (note the .md file name), so you'll need to use [proper Markdown formatting](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/#task-lists). 

In the code, you'll see `- [ ]` you'll need to add an X like so `- [X]` to check off your name.

## Pull Request etiquette
Make the Pull Request from your own GitHub account. Make sure you're changing the file in _my repo_ (not your fork). I suggest you @mention me (@joewadcan) in the Pull Request, so we can chat and fix any issues that come up.
